# Beta/develop branch for Night@SE/se-dark

Until a site is deemed complete (as in, mostly complete), it will be developed in the Beta branch. Here is the place for experiments and rapid commits.

Use this branch for developments to existing "completed" sites as well. Make the change here, test it with the Beta script, and submit a pull request to the Master branch with the change.

The script provided here will be more up-to-date, but it will also most likely have more quirks. Right now, Super User is merely using the Stack Overflow stylesheet, which may or may not change.

If you do start a new site, please add it to the supported list below, along with a status in parentheses (if uncompleted). EX: `Super User (Experimental)`. Try to use one of the following status tags:

 - `Experimental`
 - `Beta`
 - `Complete`
 
If the current status doesn't fit any of those categories, use another one, but try to keep it concise.

# Supported Beta Sites

 - Ask Ubuntu
 - Stack Overflow
 - Stack Exchange Chat
 - Super User (Experimental)
